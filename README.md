### Built with

### What I learned

I learnt how to use HTML templates. also this is the first responsive page I code. I used for the first time the browser storage to store user's theme preferences. It is also ,y first time making light and dark theme.

### Continued development

In my future projects I will be focusing on making a clean JS code. I also want to implement pub/sub pattern. Speaking about HTML I will be focusing on using semantic elements rather than generic div's.
